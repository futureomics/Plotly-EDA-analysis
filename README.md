# Plotly-EDA-analysis
Plotly EDA analysis and visualization 
Plotly is an interactive visualization library that is great for creating dynamic and aesthetically pleasing plots. It's particularly useful for biological data analysis because it allows you to interact with the plot, zoom in, and hover to get more information, which can be valuable when dealing with complex biological data.

Let's go over some basic Plotly examples first, and then we'll dive into biological data examples (using sample biological data like gene expression or species distribution).
